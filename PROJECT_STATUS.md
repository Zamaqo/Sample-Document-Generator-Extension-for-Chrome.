# Project Status: Sample Document Generator Chrome Extension

## Current State

- **Extension Structure:**
  - `manifest.json` is configured for Chrome Manifest V3, with permissions for downloads and storage.
  - Popup UI (`popup.html`) allows users to select from 5 document types: ID Card, Passport, Wine Bottle, College Degree, Dive Log.
  - `popup.js` generates a sample image for the selected document type using HTML5 Canvas, including:
    - Document type and sample data
    - Current date
    - Zamaqo company logo (top-right corner, scaled)
  - Extension icons (16x16, 48x48, 128x128) and company logo are present in the `icons/` directory.
  - README provides installation and usage instructions.

- **Functionality:**
  - User selects a document type from the popup.
  - A sample image is generated with relevant sample data, date, and logo.
  - The image is automatically downloaded as a PNG file.

## What Works
- Extension loads and displays correctly in Chrome.
- All document types generate a sample image with the correct layout and logo.
- Images are saved to the Downloads folder.
- Company branding is present on all generated images.

## Next Steps / Recommendations

1. **Template Improvements:**
   - Add more realistic sample data for each document type (e.g., fields, background patterns, watermarks).
   - Allow user input for custom names, dates, or numbers.
   - Improve visual design for each document type (e.g., mimic real document layouts).

2. **Logo Customization:**
   - Allow users to upload or select a different logo.
   - Add a setting to toggle logo visibility or placement.

3. **Image Format Options:**
   - Let users choose between PNG and JPG formats.
   - Allow selection of image resolution/size.

4. **User Experience:**
   - Add notifications or confirmations when an image is saved.
   - Provide a preview before downloading.
   - Add a settings page for further customization.

5. **Code Quality:**
   - Refactor `popup.js` for modularity and maintainability.
   - Add comments and documentation to the code.

6. **Testing:**
   - Test on different platforms and Chrome versions.
   - Add automated tests for core logic (if possible).

7. **Distribution:**
   - Prepare for Chrome Web Store submission (add privacy policy, screenshots, etc.).

**Summary:**
The extension is functional and branded, providing a solid foundation for generating sample document images. The next steps should focus on improving realism, user customization, and overall user experience.
